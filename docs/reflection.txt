The dataset I used in this assignment is from my personal fantasy football dataset. I collect the statistics
from each season we play so I can run fun analysis on my league. I wrote code to accommodate multiple datasets by looping, 
but the approach would change depending on the data. I coded expecting each file to be a season of the same format, so I simply concatenate all
dataframes and return them as one file for analysis. If it was not the same type of file (say I wanted NFL regular season schedule data), 
I would likely loop through with conditionals. I would either use naming convention of table structure to decide what collection of data it
belongs to and what sort of data cleaning is required and output as many types of files as necessary.

I saved my graph in "reports/figures/average_points_by_manager.png". It is viewable as a .png file.
